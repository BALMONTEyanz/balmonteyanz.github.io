            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Shame</li>
        </ul>

        <br>I meet them in a church. They are my churchmate which now my friends.
        I am so thankful for them especially with our pastor which became our second father who guide us and always encourage us to study well
        and most especially teach us how to be good daughter and son to God.

        <br>For now, they are what makes me happy and entertain me. They have a big role in my life
        especially BTS, their songs  are really inspiring. They are not just singer and performer. 
        They are really an artist who save people with their songs thats why they are now a Legend.
        And Im so proud to be fan of them. I hope Enhypen, an undebut group but already famous. Good songs, good performance Im really looking forward for it. <br>
